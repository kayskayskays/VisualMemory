# VisualMemory
## A minigame that tests visual memory ability.

### Description

This project was created using Java, and mainly relies on Swing to provide
a GUI that the player can interact with. 

### Gameplay

A number of tiles will flash at the player, and the player must memorise
the position of all of these tiles for as many rounds as they can. The size
of the grid and the number of flashing tiles to be memorised can be adjusted
in the 'Options' menu found within the title screen.

### Compilation

Via the usage of the provided ```build.xml``` file, one can compile and run 
the program by running the following code in the command-line, given that
Apache Ant has been installed:

``` ant compile jar run ```
